# Summary of sub-theme projects and demonstration of technical capabilities

## Project Overview
This report aims to summarize my subtopic projects and highlight the techniques and tools I used in the projects to showcase my development capabilities and skills.

# Technology and Tools
During the project development process, I widely used the following web production techniques and tools:

## HTML5: 
HTML5 is the latest HTML standard, which provides powerful semantic elements and multimedia support, making the web page structure clear and interactive.

## Responsive design: 
To ensure good display of web pages on different devices.

## JavaScript: 
JavaScript is a scripting language used for interactive and dynamic functionality of web pages. I used JavaScript in the project to achieve interactive special effects.


In addition to the above core technologies, I also use a series of auxiliary tools to improve development efficiency and code quality, such as:

## Version control: 
I use Git for code version control, and use code hosting platforms such as GitHub for collaborative development and teamwork.

## Debugging tools: 
I use the browser's developer tools to debug and inspect web pages to ensure code correctness and performance.
