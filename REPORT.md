# Summary of sub-theme projects and demonstration of technical capabilities

## Project Overview
This report aims to summarize my subtopic projects and highlight the techniques and tools I used in the projects to showcase my development capabilities and skills.

# Technology and Tools
During the project development process, I widely used the following web production techniques and tools:

## Responsive design: 
To ensure good display of web pages on different devices.

## JavaScript: 
JavaScript is a scripting language used for interactive and dynamic functionality of web pages. I used JavaScript in the project to achieve interactive special effects.


In addition to the above core technologies, I also use a series of auxiliary tools to improve development efficiency and code quality, such as:

## Version control: 
I use Git for code version control, and use code hosting platforms such as GitHub for collaborative development and teamwork.

## Debugging tools: 
I use the browser's developer tools to debug and inspect web pages to ensure code correctness and performance.


# Demonstration of development ability
In the project, I have demonstrated excellent development ability and skills. The following are my core competencies in web page production:

## Front-end development: 
I have solid PHP and CSS coding skills to build web interfaces that meet modern standards.

## Responsive Design: 
I am familiar with the principles and techniques of responsive design and am able to create web page layouts that adapt to different devices and screen sizes.

## Teamwork: 
I have good teamwork and communication skills, and enjoy working closely with designers, backend developers, and product managers to drive project success.


# Summarize

Through this U3A project, I have demonstrated my technical and tool use ability in web production, as well as my development ability and skills. I am proficient in modern web authoring techniques and tools, able to build web applications with good user experience and responsive design.

I look forward to being able to use my skills and experience on a future employer's team and contributing to their web production projects.
